##Instructions for creating a new release of the client code to push to the
##shellsink PPA.  Of course *I* use shellsink for this, but I thought somebody
##else might have to do this someday.

##Dependencies:
-dput
-debuild
-dch

##Make the ~/.dput.cf file have this entry
[shellsink-ppa]
fqdn = ppa.launchpad.net
method = ftp
incoming = ~shellsink/ubuntu/
login = anonymous
allow_unsigned_uploads = 0

##Of course you need the shellsink pgp key to sign packages

##Steps:
bzr co lp:shellsink #get the code
cd shellsink 
mv client shellsink #the directory we are packaging must match package name
cd shellsink/debian
dch -v 0.2.0 #update the changelog and version
debuild -S #build the source deb
cd ../..
dput shellsink-ppa shellsink_0.2.0_source.changes #send the change to the ppa
